            I am a musician with many years of stage experience and a teacher.
            During my musical career, I had the pleasure of performing on many
            Polish and European stages with outstanding musicians and
            conductors. Since 2018, I have been an active participant of the
            "Classical Music Festival" in Eisenstadt. In 2023, I had the
            pleasure of working with outstanding musicians from the chamber
            orchestra "The Splitzki Virtuozi", where we performed several
            concerts together, including: Split, Zadar, Durbovnik.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond my musical endeavors, I am deeply involved in educational
            pursuits, fostering a nurturing environment where I impart my wealth
            of knowledge, offer valuable insights, and instill a profound love
            for music. Through my teaching activities, I aim to empower aspiring
            musicians, guiding them through their artistic journey, and igniting
            their creative spark.

            I entered the world of programming as an autodidact, starting with a
            short course in cybersecurity. Even though my first steps were
            directed towards the frontend, my enthusiasm for learning pushed me
            to expand my horizons during the first two years of my IT adventure.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a front-end developer, I can boast of participating in several
            fascinating projects, including creating websites for a neurologist
            and a pediatrician. Each of these projects was an opportunity not
            only to use my technical skills, but also to create solutions that
            had a significant impact on people's lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            On March 17, 2024, I joined the prestigious "Za Rączka" mentoring
            program, where I started my adventure with backend development and
            other fascinating aspects of the IT world. This new path opens up
            unlimited possibilities for me, giving me the opportunity to
            constantly develop and explore new areas of technology.

            When I'm not exploring the latest UI/UX trends or experimenting with
            new libraries in JavaScript, you'll find me behind the lens of a
            camera. Video creation is not just a skill but a way for me to share
            stories and experiences, capturing emotions in cinematic frames.
            This passion drives me to constantly improve my craft, from
            mastering advanced editing techniques to experimenting with
            different filming styles and technologies. I invest significant time
            in understanding the nuances of visual storytelling, studying the
            work of renowned filmmakers and analyzing their use of lighting,
            camera angles, and shot composition to convey complex emotions and
            narratives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond the technical aspects, I enjoy the collaborative nature of
            video production. Working with a team of talented individuals,
            including directors, sound designers, and actors, teaches me the
            importance of communication and coordination in achieving a shared
            artistic goal. Each project presents unique challenges and
            opportunities, pushing me to think creatively and adapt quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interest in video creation extends to various genres and formats,
            from short films and documentaries to music videos and commercial
            content. This versatility not only broadens my skill set but also
            keeps my work dynamic and engaging.
